# Amazon QLDB Go Driver

This is the Go driver for [Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/), which allows Golang developers 
to write software that makes use of Amazon QLDB.

For getting started with the driver, see [Go and Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.go.html).

## Requirements

### Basic Configuration

See [Accessing Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/accessing.html) for information on connecting to AWS.

### Required Golang versions

qldbdriver 0.1.0 requires Golang 1.14 or later.

Please see the link below for more detail to install Golang:

[Golang Download](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Getting Started

First, install the driver using go get:

```go get github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-go/qldbdriver```

For more instructions on working with the golang driver, please refer to the instructions below.

1. [Getting Started with Amazon QLDB Go Driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.golang.html) A guide that gets you started with executing transactions with the QLDB Go driver.
2. For a quick start on how to interact with the driver, please refer to [Go Driver Quick Start](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-quickstart-golang.html).
3. QLDB Golang driver accepts and returns [Amazon ION](http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/) Documents. Amazon Ion is a richly-typed, self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format offering interchangeable binary and text representations. For more information read the [ION docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ion-python/).
4. Amazon QLDB supports a subset of the [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/) query language. PartiQL provides SQL-compatible query access across multiple data stores containing structured data, semistructured data, and nested data. For more information read the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html).
5. Refer the section [Common Errors while using the Amazon QLDB Drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-errors.html) which describes runtime errors that can be thrown by the Amazon QLDB Driver when calling the qldb-session APIs.

## Development

### Setup
Assuming that you have Golang installed, use the below command to clone the driver repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-go.git
$ cd amazon-qldb-driver-go
```
Changes can now be made in the repository.
### Running Tests

All the tests can be run by running the following command in the qldbdriver folder. Please make sure to setup and configure an AWS account to run the integration tests.
```
go test -v
```

To only run the unit tests:

```
go test -v -short
```

To only run the integration tests:

```
go test -run Integration
```
